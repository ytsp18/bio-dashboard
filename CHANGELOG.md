## [1.3.7] - 2026-01-31

### Security
- **SQL Injection Vulnerability Fix**
  - Problem: `database/connection.py` had SQL Injection vulnerability in search functions
  - Using f-string formatting to build SQL queries with user input
  - Solution: Changed to parameterized queries with SQLAlchemy `text()` and `:param` placeholders
  - Risk Level: HIGH - Could allow attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands
  - Files: `database/connection.py`
  - Commit: `afdeb03`

- **Credential Rotation**
  - Rotated database password after security audit
  - Generated new cookie key (64-char hex)
  - Updated Streamlit Cloud secrets
  - Old credentials invalidated

- **Security Audit Findings**
  - ✅ Fixed: SQL Injection in search queries
  - ✅ Fixed: Credential exposure (password rotation)
  - ⚠️ Warning: RLS (Row Level Security) disabled on Supabase tables
    - Not critical for this app (uses direct connection with password, not Supabase API)
    - Can be enabled later for additional security layer

### Fixed
- **Supabase Connection Issues**
  - Problem: "Circuit breaker open" error after credential rotation
  - Root cause: IP was banned due to repeated failed connection attempts
  - Solution: Unban IP from Supabase Network Bans + wait for circuit breaker reset
  - Database restart required to clear connection pool state

### Infrastructure
- **Supabase Configuration**
  - Using Session Pooler (IPv4 compatible) for Streamlit Cloud
  - Connection URL: `aws-1-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432`
  - IPv6 direct connection not supported on Streamlit Cloud

---

## [1.3.6] - 2026-01-31

### Added
- **Duplicate Data Check for All Upload Types**
  - Appointment: Check `appointment_id` - ❌ **บล็อก** ถ้าพบซ้ำ
  - QLog: Check `qlog_id` - ❌ **บล็อก** ถ้าพบซ้ำ
  - Card Delivery: Check `serial_number` - ❌ **บล็อก** ถ้าพบซ้ำ
  - Bio Raw: Check `serial_number + print_status` - ⚠️ **Warning เท่านั้น** (อนุญาตซ้ำสำหรับ verify G/B status)
  - Files: `pages/1_📤_Upload.py`

### Fixed
- **Bio Raw Upload: emergency column type error**
  - Problem: `invalid input syntax for type integer: "0.0"` when using COPY
  - Root cause: Excel data has float values (0.0) but PostgreSQL expects integer
  - Solution: Convert emergency column from float to int before COPY export
  - Files: `pages/1_📤_Upload.py`

---

## [1.3.5] - 2026-01-31

### Added
- **Card Delivery Upload Support**
  - New Tab "📦 Card Delivery" in Upload page
  - Support for Card-Delivery-Report-*.xlsx files
  - Handles appointment IDs starting with 68/69 (delivery appointments)
  - No SLA time data (different from Bio Raw)
  - Database models: `CardDeliveryUpload`, `CardDeliveryRecord`
  - Uses COPY protocol for fast bulk insert
  - Test: 196 records (G: 191, B: 5) uploaded successfully
  - Files: `database/models.py`, `pages/1_📤_Upload.py`

### Fixed
- **numpy.int64 PostgreSQL Error**
  - Problem: `can't adapt type 'numpy.int64'` when inserting Card Delivery
  - Solution: Convert pandas value_counts() results to Python int
  - Files: `pages/1_📤_Upload.py`

---

## [1.3.4] - 2026-01-31

### Performance
- **Optimized Bulk Insert for Large Files (30MB+)**
  - Problem: Uploading 6.4MB file (24K records) took extremely long, stuck at 30% progress
  - Root cause: SQLAlchemy `insert()` with batch is slow due to parameter binding overhead
  - Solution v1: Use `psycopg2.extras.execute_values()` - 10-50x faster
  - Solution v2: Upgrade to PostgreSQL `COPY` protocol - additional 2-5x faster
  - Test results:
    - 6.4MB (24K records): ✅ Fast
    - 31MB (130K records): ✅ Fast (appointment-january.csv)
  - Changes:
    - All uploads now use `COPY FROM STDIN WITH CSV`
    - SQLite fallback: Use `pandas.to_sql()` with `method='multi'`
  - Files: `pages/1_📤_Upload.py`

---

## [1.3.3] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **Unique Serial (G) Calculation**
  - Problem: Dashboard showed 21,616 instead of correct 21,599
  - Root cause: Simple addition of center + delivery counts instead of true unique count
  - Solution: Use `UNION ALL` + `COUNT(DISTINCT)` to count unique serials across both tables
  - Files: `pages/2_📈_Overview.py`

- **Unique Serial Reading from Excel**
  - Problem: Preview showed wrong Unique Serial value
  - Root cause: Reading from wrong cell "รวม Unique Serial Number (G)" (Row 74) instead of "G (บัตรดี) - Unique Serial" (Row 12)
  - Solution: Read from correct cell with priority for "G Unique Serial หลังหัก Validation" (Row 106) when available
  - Files: `services/excel_parser.py`

- **Bad Cards Count Missing Delivery**
  - Problem: Bad cards count didn't include delivery cards with B status
  - Solution: Count B cards from both `Card` and `DeliveryCard` tables
  - Files: `pages/2_📈_Overview.py`

- **Import Stats Not Matching Excel**
  - Problem: After import showed 21,586 instead of 21,603
  - Solution: Read total_good, total_bad, total_records from Summary Sheet (most accurate)
  - Files: `services/data_service.py`

- **Monthly Report Parsing Failed**
  - Problem: Monthly reports (Jan 2026) not displaying in Overview
  - Root cause: Monthly files have title rows at top (e.g., "รายการบัตรดี (G) - จำนวน 95,431 รายการ") before column headers
  - Solution: Detect header row containing 'ลำดับ' and restructure dataframe
  - Files: `services/excel_parser.py` - `parse_good_cards()`, `parse_bad_cards()`

### Added
- **Refresh Button on Overview Page**
  - Added "🔄 รีเฟรช" button to clear cache and reload data
  - Reduced date range cache from 5 minutes to 1 minute
  - Files: `pages/2_📈_Overview.py`

### Changed
- **Unique Serial Priority Reading**
  - Priority 1: "G Unique Serial หลังหัก Validation" (post-validation deduction)
  - Priority 2: "G (บัตรดี) - Unique Serial" (fallback)
  - Supports both daily and monthly report formats

---

  - Summary table now shows only items requiring review:
    - รายการนัดหมายที่มีบัตรดีมากกว่า 1 ใบ (Appt ID G>1)
    - Card ID ที่มีบัตรดีมากกว่า 1 ใบ (รหัสประจำตัวคนต่างด้าว)
  - 4 focused tabs: ผิดวัน, ผิดศูนย์, Appt G>1, Card ID G>1

### Added
- **Anomaly Page - Wrong Branch Tab**

### Fixed
- **Anomaly Logic - Match Excel Report**
  - Changed Anomaly G>1 counting from Appointment ID to Card ID
  - Now matches Excel report exactly:
    - ออกบัตรหลายใบรวม: 120 ✓
    - Reissue ปกติ: 114 ✓
    - Anomaly G>1: 6 ✓

---

## [1.3.1] - 2026-01-28

### Added

### Fixed
- **Overview Page Logic Corrections**
  - Fixed "บัตรจัดส่ง" count - now uses `DeliveryCard` table (Sheet 7) correctly
  - Fixed "บัตรสมบูรณ์" count - now uses Unique Serial instead of row count
  - Fixed "ข้อมูลไม่ครบ" - checks all 4 required fields (Appt ID, Card ID, Serial, Work Permit)

## [1.1.2] - 2026-01-28

### Added
- **Database Indexes for Performance Optimization**
  - Added 9 indexes on `cards` table for faster queries:
    - `ix_cards_print_date` - Date range filtering

- Optimized connection pool settings for Streamlit Cloud serverless environment

---

## [1.1.1] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- **Critical: Database timeout on large imports**
  - Problem: Uploading files with 50K+ records caused Supabase timeout, cards table stayed empty
  - Solution: Added batch flush every 500 records to prevent connection timeout
  - Files: `services/data_service.py`

### Changed
- Migrated to new Supabase project (`bio-dashboard-fts`) for clean database
- Updated Session Pooler URL to `aws-1-ap-southeast-1`

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-28

### Changed
- `database/connection.py` now supports both SQLite (local) and PostgreSQL (cloud)
- Automatic fallback to SQLite if no cloud database configured

### How to Switch Database
1. **Use Supabase (cloud)**: Add `secrets.toml` with database URL
2. **Use SQLite (local)**: Remove `secrets.toml` file

---

## [1.0.4] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- **Critical: Date parsing error causing chart to show wrong dates**
  - Problem: Chart displayed data on Jan 12, 2025 which didn't exist in uploaded data
  - Root cause: Excel files had inconsistent date formats - some cells stored as string "DD-MM-YYYY", others as datetime objects with day/month swapped
  - Solution: Enhanced `parse_date_value()` with `report_month` parameter to detect and correct day/month swaps
  - Files: `services/excel_parser.py`, `services/data_service.py`

### Changed
- Re-imported all data (Oct, Nov, Dec 2568) with corrected date parsing
- All dates now correctly display within their respective months

## [1.0.3] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- **Summary statistics not matching Excel Summary sheet**
  - Problem: Dashboard showed 2,881 good cards, Excel Summary showed 2,884
  - Root cause: Reading from Sheet 2 only (pickup cards), missing delivery cards from Sheet 7
  - Solution: Modified `get_summary_stats()` to read directly from Sheet 1 Summary

### Added
- New statistics fields:
  - `good_pickup`: Good cards received at center
  - `good_delivery`: Good cards via delivery
  - `unique_serial_g`: Total unique serial numbers (G)

### Changed
- Upload preview now shows additional statistics:
  - Good cards - pickup
  - Good cards - delivery
  - Unique Serial (G)

## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- **Good rate calculation error**
  - Problem: Good rate showed 94.67% instead of correct 98.32%
  - Root cause: Dividing by total records including NULL status cards
  - Solution: Calculate good rate using only printed cards (G + B)

```python
# Before (wrong)
good_rate = good / total * 100

# After (correct)
printed_total = good + bad
good_rate = good / printed_total * 100
```

### Changed
- Updated `get_dashboard_stats()` in `data_service.py`
- Updated `app.py` dashboard display

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-28

```python
# Clear existing data
DELETE FROM cards;
DELETE FROM delivery_cards;
DELETE FROM reports;

# Re-import all reports through the Upload page
```

### From 1.0.0 to 1.0.1
Run database migration to add `delivery_cards` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS delivery_cards (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    report_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    appointment_id VARCHAR(50),
    serial_number VARCHAR(20),
    print_status VARCHAR(10),
    card_id VARCHAR(20),
    work_permit_no VARCHAR(20),
    FOREIGN KEY (report_id) REFERENCES reports(id)
);
```
